# Title: Setup Project Repository
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Initialize the project repository with the necessary configurations and dependencies.
# Details:
The project setup is fully functional with a Docker environment. The frontend React project is configured and complete with React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Axios, Shadcn/UI, React Router, Sonner, and TypeScript strict mode. ESLint and Prettier are configured for code quality. The project structure includes a complete frontend in `/frontend/` and a backend Node.js with functioning CNAB APIs in `/api/`. Docker containers are running: `cnab-frontend` on port 3000, `cnab-api` on port 8080, and `cnab-mysql` on port 3306. All health checks are passing.
