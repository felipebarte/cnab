# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Multi-State Segment J Parser
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the Segment J multi-state parser with the existing system and create comprehensive tests.
# Details:
Focus on integrating the SegmentJMultiStateParser with the existing CNAB240 processing system, ensuring seamless operation with other components like MonetaryConverter, SegmentBProcessor, and MergeSystem.

# Test Strategy:
Develop comprehensive integration tests to ensure the Segment J parser works correctly within the system, and create unit tests for edge cases using CNAB240 samples.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Existing Python Script [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current Python script to understand its structure and logic.
### Details:
Focus on identifying how the script processes data and where the new parser logic will fit.

## 2. Design Parser Logic for Segment J [done]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create a detailed plan for implementing the parser that processes two consecutive lines of Segment J.
### Details:
Ensure the design includes handling of main payment data on the first line and payer-specific data on the second line, with iteration control.

## 3. Implement Parser Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.2
### Description: Develop the parser logic based on the design to correctly process Segment J.
### Details:
Write the code to integrate the new parser logic into the existing script, ensuring it processes two lines without duplication.

## 4. Integrate References and Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Ensure all necessary references and dependencies are correctly integrated into the script.
### Details:
Check for any external libraries or modules that need to be included for the parser to function correctly.

## 5. Create Unit Tests for Parser Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 3.3
### Description: Develop unit tests to verify the functionality of the new parser logic.
### Details:
Write tests that cover various scenarios, including edge cases, to ensure the parser processes data accurately.

## 6. Integrate SegmentJMultiStateParser with Existing System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure the SegmentJMultiStateParser is fully integrated with the existing CNAB240 processing system.
### Details:
Coordinate with other components like MonetaryConverter, SegmentBProcessor, and MergeSystem to ensure seamless operation.

## 7. Develop Comprehensive Integration Tests [done]
### Dependencies: 3.6
### Description: Create integration tests to validate the Segment J parser within the complete system.
### Details:
Ensure tests cover interactions with other system components and handle various data scenarios.
