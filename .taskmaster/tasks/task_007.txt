# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Intelligent Merge System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a system to merge results from the current and specific parsers.
# Details:
Create logic to combine existing API data with new parser results, adding a 'pagamentosEspecificos' section and processing metadata.

# Test Strategy:
Test merging logic with outputs from both parsers to ensure data integrity and correctness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Parser and API Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing parser and API data structures to understand the data formats and fields.
### Details:
Examine the data output from the current parser and the API to identify key fields and data types that need to be preserved or merged.

## 2. Design Intelligent Merge Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a plan for the intelligent merge logic that combines parser results with API data.
### Details:
Develop a strategy for merging data that includes rules for preserving existing API data and integrating new sections such as 'pagamentosEspecificos'.

## 3. Implement Data Combination Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Develop the code to implement the designed merge logic.
### Details:
Write the necessary code to combine the parser results with the API data, ensuring data integrity and adherence to the designed logic.

## 4. Add Metadata Processing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Incorporate metadata processing to track comparative processing details.
### Details:
Implement functionality to generate and store metadata that records details of the data merging process for future reference and analysis.

## 5. Implement Activation Flag for Rollback [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Develop a flag system to enable or disable the merge logic for rollback purposes.
### Details:
Create a mechanism to toggle the merge logic on or off, allowing for easy rollback if necessary.

## 6. Test and Validate Merge System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of the merge system to ensure it functions correctly and meets requirements.
### Details:
Perform tests to validate the merge logic, metadata processing, and rollback functionality, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.
